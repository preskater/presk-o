# Backup and restore

Take a logical backup, prove it restores, and recover a database from one. The scripts
live in `infra/backups/`; this page is the operator procedure. Script internals and the
file format are documented in [infra/backups/README.md](../../infra/backups/README.md).

A dump contains personal financial data. It is git-ignored, excluded from the Docker
build context, and must never be committed, attached to a ticket or pasted into chat.

## What the scripts do

| Script | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `./infra/backups/backup.sh [output-directory]` | `pg_dump` in custom format, written on the host with a `.sha256` and a `.json` metadata file next to it. Default directory: `infra/backups`. |
| `./infra/backups/verify.sh <dump-file>` | Checks the checksum, restores into a throwaway PostgreSQL container, and writes `<dump>.verification.json` with `"status": "verified"` or `"failed"`. |
| `./infra/backups/restore.sh <dump-file> <target-database>` | Drops and recreates the target database, then restores the dump into it. |
| `./infra/backups/test-backup-cycle.sh` | Automated end-to-end test of the three scripts on a throwaway stack (CI runs it). |

`backup.sh` and `restore.sh` target the compose `db` service by default. Set
`DB_CONTAINER=<name>` to target a throwaway container instead; that is how the restore
rehearsal below stays away from real data. They do not read `.env`: export
`POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_DB` when they differ from `dashboard`.

## Take and verify a backup

**Read-only on the database.**

```sh
./infra/backups/backup.sh
./infra/backups/verify.sh infra/backups/dashboard-<timestamp>.dump
```

`backup.sh` prints the new file name; use that timestamp. `verify.sh` needs Docker: it
starts a disposable PostgreSQL container with the image read from `compose.yaml`, with
no published port and no volume, and removes it at the end even on failure.

A backup is usable only when its `.verification.json` says `"verified"`. A `"failed"`
result names the reason:

| Reason | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `checksum mismatch` | The file changed after it was written (copy, disk, transfer). | Take a new backup; do not use this file. |
| `pg_restore failed` | The archive cannot be loaded even though its checksum is valid. | Take a new backup; compare the `pgDump` and `serverVersion` in the `.json`. |
| `no _prisma_migrations table` | The dump is not a dashboard database. | Check which database was dumped. |
| `the backup contains a failed migration` | The source database had an unresolved failed migration. | Fix the migration first (see [Migration deployment](./migrations.md)). |

## Rehearse a restore on a throwaway container

**Mutating, on throwaway data only.** This proves a real dump loads without touching the
compose database.

```sh
CONTAINER="presk-o-restore-rehearsal-$$"
docker run -d --rm --name "$CONTAINER" --tmpfs /var/lib/postgresql -p 127.0.0.1::5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=dashboard -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dashboard -e POSTGRES_DB=dashboard \
  postgres:18.6-alpine3.24
until docker exec "$CONTAINER" pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -U dashboard -d dashboard >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done

DB_CONTAINER="$CONTAINER" ./infra/backups/restore.sh \
  infra/backups/dashboard-<timestamp>.dump dashboard_restore_check

docker exec "$CONTAINER" psql -U dashboard -d dashboard_restore_check -tA \
  -c "SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';"
docker exec "$CONTAINER" psql -U dashboard -d dashboard_restore_check -tA \
  -c "SELECT count(*) FROM _prisma_migrations WHERE finished_at IS NOT NULL;"

docker rm -f "$CONTAINER"
```

Compare the two counts with `tables` and `migrations` in the dump's
`.verification.json`. The automated `test-backup-cycle.sh` does the same comparison and
also checks that corrupt archives are rejected.

## Recover a deployment

**Mutating.** This replaces the current database content with the dump. Read the whole
sequence before starting.

1. **Identify the dump**: the newest one whose `.verification.json` says `"verified"`.
   If none is verified, run `verify.sh` on the candidate first, and prefer a second
   candidate if it fails.
2. **Stop the application** so no session keeps the database open:
   ```sh
   docker compose --profile full stop app
   ```
   Without this, `DROP DATABASE` fails with `database "…" is being accessed by other
   users`.
3. **Preserve the current state when possible**, even if it is damaged:
   ```sh
   ./infra/backups/backup.sh /tmp/incident
   ```
   If the dump fails, record why; a failing dump is itself diagnostic evidence. This
   directory is outside the repository and contains personal data: delete it once the
   incident is closed.
4. **Restore** into the database named by `POSTGRES_DB` (export it first when it is not
   `dashboard`, because the script does not read `.env`):
   ```sh
   ./infra/backups/restore.sh \
     infra/backups/dashboard-<timestamp>.dump "${POSTGRES_DB:-dashboard}"
   ```
5. **Start the application** so the one-shot services run in order:
   ```sh
   docker compose --profile full up -d
   ```
   `migrate` applies any migration newer than the dump; `seed` refreshes the owner name
   and keeps the stored password unless `SEED_OWNER_FORCE_PASSWORD=true` (keep it
   `false` during a recovery).
6. **Verify the restored system**:
   - sign in with the owner account;
   - open **Diagnostic** (`/diagnostics`) and confirm database and migrations are OK;
   - spot-check a data page: the budget month totals, the last transactions, one
     property;
   - compare the newest operation date with the dump's creation date: anything created
     after that dump is legitimately absent.
7. **Take a new backup and verify it**. The restored database is now the baseline:
   ```sh
   ./infra/backups/backup.sh
   ./infra/backups/verify.sh infra/backups/dashboard-<new-timestamp>.dump
   ```

### If the restore fails

| Symptom | Cause and action |
| --- | --- |
| `database "…" is being accessed by other users` | The app or another client is connected. Stop `app` and retry. |
| `Dump file not found` | Wrong path; scripts run from the repository root. |
| `role "…" does not exist` | `POSTGRES_USER` does not match the database role. Export the right value. |
| `pg_restore: error: unsupported version` | The dump was produced by a newer PostgreSQL major. Use a matching image / `POSTGRES_IMAGE`, see the upgrade notes in [infra/backups/README.md](../../infra/backups/README.md). |
| Restore succeeds but pages error | The dump predates a migration; step 5 must run `migrate`. Check `/diagnostics`. |

## What is still manual

- **Scheduling.** Nothing runs `backup.sh` or `verify.sh` automatically. Wire them to
  cron, a systemd timer or the platform scheduler, and alert on a non-zero exit.
- **Off-host storage.** Dumps currently stay on the same disk as the database. Copy them
  encrypted to another host or object storage, and define a retention policy (for
  example 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly).
- **Restore tests.** Run a rehearsal on a schedule, not only once. An untested backup is
  a hope.
