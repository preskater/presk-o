/**
 * Deferred synchronisation.
 *
 * This is a **job**, not a loop: the web process must stay replaceable, so a run
 * is triggered by a scheduler outside it (cron, systemd timer, platform
 * scheduler) through a script that imports these functions.
 *
 * A run is idempotent: snapshots are keyed by (connection, external project id),
 * so replaying a synchronisation updates existing rows instead of duplicating
 * them. Nothing is written if a run fails halfway: a partial synchronisation
 * must not erase projects that were merely not fetched.
 *
 * Every attempt is recorded as a `SyncRun` row (counters, status, safe error,
 * bounded retries), which is what lets the interface display freshness and explain
 * a partial or failed pass instead of showing a misleading zero.
