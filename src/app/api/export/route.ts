/**
 * CSV exports, selected by `?entity=`.
 *
 * `transactions`, `properties`, `budgets`, `goals` and `alerts` are the supported
 * entities; anything else — a missing value, a typo, `all` — answers 400 and reads
 * nothing. Each entity keeps its own route (`/api/export/transactions`, ...) for the
 * links already in the interface: both paths call the same builder, so the guards,
 * filters and audit entry are identical.
 *
 * The entity is a code, never a path or a table name: the dispatch is a `switch` over a
 * closed union, so no query string can reach a read that is not part of the catalogue.
